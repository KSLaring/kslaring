SAML Authentication for Moodle
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SAML for Moodle is an open-source implementation for federated identity-based
authentication infrastructure based on Security Assertion Markup Language
(SAML) that allows the Moodle users log in through simpleSAMLphp.


Install Instruction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1. Unpack this saml directory into the /auth/ directory as you would for any Moodle
     auth module
     (http://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_contributed_modules_or_plugins).

  2. Login to Moodle as an administrator, and activate the module by navigating
     Site administration->Plugins->Manage authentication->SAML Authentication     


  3. Let priivileges to the server user to write over the auth/saml/saml_config.php
     file.

Configuration
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After the installation we must configure the saml plugin, so go to "Settings"
if you are in "Manage Authentication" page, or you can also go to
Users > Authentication > SAML Authentication. These are the fields of thi
form:

     - simpleSAMLphp Path: it will not work unless you specify the saml library
     path. This refers to the library path for the simpleSAMLphp environment
     you want to use. For example: /var/simplesamlphp/lib

     - SAML username mapping: it is a SAML attribute that will be mapped to
     the Moodle username. By default, this attribute will be set to 'mail'.

     - Single Log out: Enable/disable the single logout. This will log out you
     from moodle, identity provider and all conected service providers

     - SAML Image: when you enable the SAML authentication plugin, a new
     button will be shown in the login Moodle page that allows to authenticate
     via SAML. By default, the simpleSAMLphp image (something like a fish) will
     be shown, but you can specify another one you want to use.
     Note: this image needs to exist in the server as it is not possible to
     upload an image through the form right now.

     - SAML login description: you can also specify a description text for the
     previous button. This description will be shown below the SAML image in
     the login Moodle page.

     - Log file path: this is the absolute path of a file where the
     plugin will log information about its actions. It is optional.

     - Hook file path: this is the absolute path of a file with php functions
     that will be called to alter the default behaviour of this plugin. See
     the file custom_hook.php for more information.

     - SAML support Courses: this select has three options:
        - No suport (default value): the plugin will not have support for
        enrolling the user into courses automatically
        - Internal: the plugin will use an internal database table to map
        the courses in the next field with Moodle courses
        - External: the plugin will use a tabla in an external database
        to map the courses in the next field with Moodle courses.

     - SAML courses mapping: it is a SAML attribute that is mapped to Moodle
     courses data. By default, it is set to 'schacUserStatus'.

     - Field used to identify a course: this can be the Short Name or the
     Number ID and referes to the Moodle field used to identify a course
     during the matching phase of the plugin.

     - Ignore inactive courses: if this field is checked the user will stay
     in previous enrolled courses even if the status of the course is
     inactive in the SAML attribute.

     - Data Mapping section:
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Identity Provider (IdP) provides some user's data such as the first
    name, surname, email address, etc. In this section, you can specify the
    correspondence with the same data in Moodle. By default, the configuration
    is set as is shown below:

        First name    = cn
        Surname       = sn
        Email Address = mail

    - Course Mapping section:
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The course mapping section allows the administrator to link saml courses
    and moodle courses. To make it working we need to create an intermediate
    database on where we can store this data. This database will have the
    following internal structure:

    +--------------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
    | Field              | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
    +--------------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
    | course_mapping_id  | int(11)     | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
    | saml_course_id     | varchar(20) | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
    | saml_course_period | int(4)      | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
    | lms_course_id      | text        | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
    +--------------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+

    Once we already have created the database, we need to specify the DSN (Data
    Source Name) that has the following syntax:

        MySQL
        -----
        mysql://user:password@host/database_name

        SQLite
        ------
        sqlite:///path/to/database/file

        PostgresSQL
        -----------
        postgres://user:password@host/database_name


    Below the database DSN field we can start introducing course mappings
    between Moodle and SAML courses.
    No field can be null, if you try to introduce a null course mapping, this
    data will be ignored and it will not be saved in the database.
    If you try to introduce a duplicate course mapping this data will not be
    saved in the database and you will be redirected to the form showing an
    error.
    If you want to delete a course mapping you must only check the
    corresponding checkbox to the left and clicking to 'delete' button.
    Also, you can update the previous introduced course mappings in every
    moment if the new data doesn't conflicts with none of the previous
    course mappings.
    Is possible to introduce several course mappings at the same time, you can
    add a new row by clicking in '+' button to the right. It no errors happen
    while introducing the course mappings, you will be redirected to the
    'Manage Authentication' page as with any other field of the form.


Internal Changes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The 'config.html' file was renamed to 'config.php' because it now has PHP
  code.
- Two new files was created in SAML plugin directory:
    - 'courses.php': this file contains the needed PHP code for showing the new
    'Course mapping' table.
    - 'DBNewDatabase.php': this file contains a tiny function for creating a
    database connection, because it seems there is a bug when you try to open
    a SQLite database connection using a DSN.

- In 'auth.php' we have used 'validate_form' for validating the form and store
the errors, and 'process_config' for saving the data into the database if
there are no errors. Also, 'sync_roles' function have been modified for
mapping roles and courses.

NOTES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These changes are tested and valid for simpleSAMLphp >= 1.7
