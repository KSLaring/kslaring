Moodle: Overview statistics report
==================================

This [Moodle](http://moodle.org) add-on produces various site and course report
charts.  The code has been designed in a way that makes adding more reports
easy.

For producing the graphs, [YUI Charts](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/charts/)
module is used.  The code is using modern Moodle development techniques and
patterns, such as using LESS for producing CSS files and Shifter to compose the
Javascript modules.

users (not visits) who accessed the site per day during the last month.
