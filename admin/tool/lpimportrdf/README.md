This is an importer for XML/RDF formatted curriculum files from the
achievement standards network.

See http://achievementstandards.org/ to browse and download various
curriculum files as RDF/XML. Not all metadata is retained when the
standards are imported - but as much as possible is.

This importer is generic enough to work well with a variety of RDF
formatted curriculum files, such as the ones from

http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/technical/download

but if you have custom requirements, or a file format that does not
import well, you should contact a Moodle Partner

http://www.moodle.com/

to have this plugin customised to your needs.
