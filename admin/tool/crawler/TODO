* Make redirects two separate nodes and track the whole thing
  - do we worry about circular? no because we already scraped??

* BUG: showing last response code but first response message

* Bug 404 see other

* Add big files traffic light

* add index for filesize and errorcode to speed up reports

keep old links for always, 1 week, 1 month, never

* make a crawl stats table, when started, how many ticks, how many urls queued, how many links, how many broken urls, when finished

* new report for links to another course, or links to another moodle

* when no broken links link to recently link report

make a cron / config for when we clean up old links and urls, default to a week ago


be able to filter drill down to a course from admin report

 - and which isn't 'ignored' do we care?

* orphans pages?
 - if broken, clean them up (ie url was a typo, so we get an entry that will never work, remove it later when it's edge is gone)

* orphaned links?
 - do we remove them?

* capability
 - ignore a broken page
