This files describes API changes for the core question system.


=== 2.6 ===

1) The method question_behaviour::is_manual_grade_in_range and move and become
question_engine::is_manual_grade_in_range.

2) The arguments to core_question_renderer::mark_summary changed from
($qa, $options) to ($qa, $behaviouroutput, $options). If you have overridden
that method you will need to update your code.


=== Earlier changes ===
