This files describes API changes for code that uses the question API.

=== 2.6 ===

1) It is sometimes necessary to display bits of question content without having
   and attempt (question_usage) in progress. Two examples of this are the option
   in the question bank to display the questiontext, and in the quiz statistics
   report, where it displays the question text above the report.

   Previously, this display was done using a special method that only worked for
   the question text, but which would not work for other parts of the question.
   That old mechanism has been deprecated, and there is a new method that you
   should use.

   To display the question, replace calls to question_rewrite_questiontext_preview_urls
   with calls to question_rewrite_question_preview_urls. Because the new function
   is more flexibile, you have to pass more arguments.

   To perform the necessary permission checks when the file is downloaded, you need
   to implement the callback [component name]_question_preview_pluginfile.
   (Previously you implemented [component name]_questiontext_preview_pluginfile.)
   quiz_statistics_question_preview_pluginfile is an example of what to do.

   question_send_questiontext_file has been deprecated. It is no longer necessary.

   To ensure you are no longer using or defining any deprecated functions,
   search for the regular expression:
   question_rewrite_questiontext_preview_urls|_questiontext_preview_pluginfile|question_send_questiontext_file
