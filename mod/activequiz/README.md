# Active Quiz

## What is it?
This is a type of quiz designed to be used in face-to-face lessons, with a classroom full of computers/tablets/phones.
The teacher creates the quiz in advance - adding question bank questions from the Moodle question bank.
(This includes any question type available for Moodle)

The quiz can be set up to take the quiz in class groups (set up through the Moodle built in groups functionality).
Group attendance may also be used in order only give present group members the final grade.

During the lesson, the teacher starts the quiz. Students can now connect to this quiz.
Once the teacher is satisfied that all students have connected to the quiz, they can click on "Start Quiz"
Depending on the question settings the question will end automatically, or will need to be ended via the instructor's
"end question" button.


The teacher can, at a later date, go back through the results and, for each question, see exactly what answer each
student gave.  Students will also be able to view their attempts based on the display options in the quiz settings

## Please note

This is a complete re-write of the realtime quiz module.
There is currently no upgrade path from the previous version,
so any existing questions in the previous realtime quiz module will
need to be moved to the question engine to be used.

Because of this, we determined that the plugin should be renamed so that both can exist,
so that people may migrate slowly to this plugin if desired.  This plugin is sufficiently
different in functionality and code structure from the current realtime quiz that also led
to having this be a "new" module vs an update.

The original plugin was written by Davo Smith, to which the University of Wisconsin - Madison
(funded by an educational innovation grant given to the Medical school) re-wrote the plugin to
use the question engine integration as well as a bunch of other new features.

This plugin is maintained by John Hoopes separately from the University.
